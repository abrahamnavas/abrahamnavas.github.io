<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A little bit about me</h3>

<p>I have been working for more than 10 years as a designer. First, as a graphic designer and art director, and then as a frontend web designer. With that background, for the last five years I have been managing mobile projects aimed on mHealth.</p>

<p>Now, I'm taking the next step, growing my professional skills as UX manager, a role that applies design transversely into any digital project. I'm very focused on apply User Centered Design techniques on every project I work in, to empower final users and bring to the market final products that they really love.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I love design</h3>

<p>Since I was a child, I was excited about all kinds of design, from print to video, including products like toys or clothes. In somehow, I was concerned about the importance of things well designed, no matter I didn't understood why.</p>

<p>Now, 25 years later, I do what I most like to do: make, build, design. I work for startups as a UX designer, helping them to build better gorgeous and useful apps that users really love.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>You are as good as your team is</h3>

<p>For long time, I tried to be a unicorn (in other words, a one-man-band) trying to be able to do all parts of a project on my own. But this has no sense; not if you want to build great products. If you really want to achieve success, you have to work with others. Not only because two, three or four brains think better and faster than a single one; but you need people specialized on vertical skills to achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UX means Lean</h3>

<p>If you really want to build a new product or service, you need to know what really matters: what your potential users or customers really think about you. To provide them what they are willing to pay for, you have to research them, prototype your idea with this insights and test it as fast as you can. Then develop and release it. And start again. And again.</p>

<p>If you also think that any kind of product should be designed putting the user on the center of the scene, please feel free to drop me some lines ;-)</p>
